      <h2>List Of Self-Created Models Used In This Project</h2>
        <h3> &ensp; 1. Fishing rod, stool, and bucket</h3>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Fishing can be common in Hawaii, so going fishing with a stool and a bucket adds a nice small touch to the scene.</p>
        <br>
      
        <h3> &ensp; 2. Beach chair and side table</h3>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; These items are commonly found in beaches or by resorts in Hawaii, but it fits the scene.</p>
        <br>
      
        <h3> &ensp; 3. Coconuts</h3>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Coconuts are pretty common around Hawaii and grow on palm trees, so they were placed around the island in the scene.</p>
        <br>
      
        <h3> &ensp; 4. Hotel and Pool</h3>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Although hotels are commonly found everywhere, the theme park feel given off by the Mickey and roller coaster models ties the hotel to Orlando. There's also a nice rooftop pool to go along with the hotel.</p>
        <br>
      
        <h3> &ensp; 5. Florida Oranges Fruit Stand</h3>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Florida is well known for their oranges, so I thought a fruit stand selling these oranges would be nice.</p>
        <br>
      
        <h3> &ensp; 6. Custom Magic 8 Ball Sayings</h3>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Positive Sayings: "For Sure" - A saying with a very sure certainty that something will happen.</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; "You Bet" - A saying with a good certainty that something will happen.</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; "100%" - A 100 percent guarantee that something will happen.</p>
      
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Unclear Sayings: "Ehhhhhh" - An unknown certainty that something may happen</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; "Come Again?" - Asking the user again because of uncertain outcome</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; "¯\_('_')_/¯" - A shrug text emoji that represents an unsure outcome</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; "idk" - shorthand slang for "I don't know"</p>
      
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Negative Sayings: "Better start praying" - Chances are slim, so pray to some god in hope that it will come true</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; "Let's not talk about it" - A negative outlook on the outcome</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; "Nah" - It's not going to happen</p>

        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Since Honolulu is a city in Hawaii, it feels appropriate for my island to be surrounded by water.</p>

        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Orlando is known for many of its theme parks, so adding a roller coaster to the scene was to represent that.</p>

        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Mickey Mouse is one of Disney's characters and since Disney World is located in Orlando, it felt appropriate to show that.</p>

        <p> &emsp;&emsp; Placeholder Image</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp; The Lifeguard towers, volleyball, and volleyball net models were used to create a small beach scene behind the hotel, since a lot of hotels are built near the beach.</p>
        <br>
      
        <h3> &ensp; 10. Ukulele music by emjaydabayou - <a href="https://freesound.org/people/emjaydabayou/sounds/539624/">Ukulele and Love Bird</a></h3>
