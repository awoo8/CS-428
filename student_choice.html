    <h1>Sniper Elite VR</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sniper Elite VR is a virtual reality game that takes the core concepts of the Sniper Elite franchise and puts
        them together in a virtual sandbox for the player to go around kill enemies and complete missions. The Sniper
        Elite games at their core are story-based, stealthy, action, shooter video games that takes place during World
        War 2. The game revolves around the player taking control of a sniper operating on the battlefield and killing
        any enemies that stand in the way between the player and the objectives. The gameplay does emphasize stealth in
        order to reach your objective, however this does not limit the player to solely playing stealthy since the game
        allows for the player to get creative when killing enemies, or the player can simply disregard stealth in most
        cases. The game also utilizes their core feature of an x-ray killcam, where the player can see the bullet fired
        from their rifle and see the devastating effects the bullet had on the enemy's body in great detail.</p>
    <h2>Why is it a good use of VR</h2>
    <p>Sniper Elite VR is a good use of VR in the sense that it brings forth a more immersive game but still keeping the
        key features that the Sniper Elite franchise is known for. Instead of the classic pc and console controlling the
        character with their respective devices, Sniper Elite VR virtually puts the player in the character's shoes,
        where the player will now have to take on multiple missions, with their own two hands and eyes, equipped with a
        sniper rifle and other weapons at their disposal.</p>
    <h2>Who are its intended users?</h2>
    <p>The intended users are going to be from the gaming community. Many players would have played the previous Sniper
        Elite games and would be looking forward to playing something with a fresh twist on something that was
        previously enjoyable. For example, killing an enemy with a sniper rifle and activating the x-ray killcam to see
        a cool visual, except in VR you get to have a more immersive interaction with aiming the sniper rifle's scope
        and pulling the trigger on the enemy.</p>
