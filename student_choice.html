        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Sniper Elite VR is a virtual reality game that takes the core concepts of the Sniper Elite franchise and puts
            them together in a virtual sandbox for the player to go around kill enemies and complete missions. The
            Sniper Elite games at their core are story-based, stealthy, action, shooter video games that takes place
            during World War 2. The game revolves around the player taking control of a sniper operating on the
            battlefield and killing any enemies that stand in the way between the player and the objectives. The
            gameplay does emphasize stealth in order to reach your objective, however this does not limit the player to
            solely playing stealthy since the game allows for the player to get creative when killing enemies, or the
            player can simply disregard stealth in most cases. The game also utilizes their core feature of an x-ray
            killcam, where the player can see the bullet fired from their rifle and see the devastating effects the
            bullet had on the enemy's body in great detail.</p>

        <h2>Why is it a good use of VR</h2>
        <p>Sniper Elite VR is a good use of VR in the sense that it brings forth a more immersive game but still keeping
            the key features that the Sniper Elite franchise is known for. Instead of the classic pc and console
            controlling the character with their respective devices, Sniper Elite VR virtually puts the player in the
            character's shoes, where the player will now have to take on multiple missions, with their own two hands and
            eyes, equipped with a sniper rifle and other weapons at their disposal.</p>

        <h2>Who are its intended users?</h2>
        <p>The intended users are going to be from the gaming community, who own a VR headset or the Playstation VR.
            Many players would have played the previous Sniper Elite games and would be looking forward to playing
            something with a fresh twist on something that was previously enjoyable. For example, killing an enemy with
            a sniper rifle and activating the x-ray killcam to see a cool visual, except in VR you get to have a more
            immersive interaction with aiming the sniper rifle's scope and pulling the trigger on the enemy.</p>
